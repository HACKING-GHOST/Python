Task
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.



-------
C O D E
-------



if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a+b)
    print(a-b)
    print(a*b)


Good. This is a **simple problem**, which makes it *perfect* for learning how to explain code **cleanly and correctly without overthinking**. If you can’t explain *this* well, you’re not ready for harder ones.

Below is a **GitHub-ready explanation** using the **Code Explanation Framework**. You can paste this directly under your code.

# 🔹 Problem: Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python

## 1. Problem Restatement

Two integers `a` and `b` are given as input.
We must compute and print:

1. Their sum
2. Their difference (`a - b`)
3. Their product

Each result must be printed on a new line.

---

## 2. Core Idea / Insight

This problem tests **basic arithmetic operations and input/output handling** in Python.

The key idea is straightforward:

* Read integers from standard input
* Apply arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`)
* Print results in the required order

No loops or conditions are needed because each operation is independent.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Logic (Without Code)

1. Read the first integer and store it.
2. Read the second integer and store it.
3. Add the two numbers and print the result.
4. Subtract the second number from the first and print the result.
5. Multiply the two numbers and print the result.

Each operation is executed exactly once.

---

## 4. Code Walkthrough (Logic → Implementation)

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

* Ensures the code runs only when the file is executed directly, not when imported.

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
```

* `input()` reads values as strings.
* `int()` converts them to integers so arithmetic operations are possible.

```python
print(a + b)
```

* Computes and prints the sum of `a` and `b`.

```python
print(a - b)
```

* Computes and prints the difference (`a - b`), respecting the order.

```python
print(a * b)
```

* Computes and prints the product of the two numbers.

---

## 5. Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(1)`
  Each arithmetic operation is constant time.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  Only two integer variables are stored.

---

## 6. Why This Solution Is Optimal

* The task requires exactly three arithmetic operations.
* Any solution must read both inputs and compute these values.
* No loops, conditions, or additional data structures are necessary.
* This is the **simplest and most efficient** way to solve the problem.

---

## 7. Common Mistakes & Traps

* Forgetting to convert input to `int`, leading to string concatenation instead of addition.
* Printing results in the wrong order.
* Using `b - a` instead of `a - b`.
* Adding unnecessary logic like loops or conditionals.

---

## 8. Trade-offs & Alternatives

* Arithmetic could be done in one line, but that would reduce readability.
* Using variables for results (e.g., `sum = a + b`) improves clarity but is optional.
* This solution prioritizes **clarity and minimalism**.

---

## 9. Pattern Recognition (Meta-Learning)

This problem introduces patterns that appear everywhere:

* Input parsing
* Type conversion
* Ordered output
* Basic arithmetic logic

These fundamentals are reused in:

* Competitive programming
* Interview problems
* Real-world data processing tasks
