Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  2 to 5, print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  6 to 20 , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird

elif n % 2 == 0 and 2 <= n <=5 :
    print("Not Weird")                    # Even and between 2 to 5 (inclusive)
elif n % 2 == 0 and 6 <= n <= 20 :
    print("Weird")                        # Even and between 6 to 20 (inclusive)
elif n % 2 == 0 and n > 20 :
    print("Not Weird")                    # Even and greater than 20


Clear Structure
Uses if–elif–else, not nested chaos
Easy to read and maintain
Each condition is mutually exclusive

Time Complexity
O(1) → constant time
Only a few comparisons
No loops, no recursion, no memory overhead

Space Complexity
O(1) → one integer variable
No extra data structures

WHAT NOT TO DO (COMMON MISTAKES)
❌ Repeating n % 2 == 0 everywhere
❌ Using < instead of <=
❌ Writing unnecessary elif n > 20
❌ Nesting ifs inside ifs
❌ Over-optimizing a constant-time problem
