Task
The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division,  a/b .
No rounding or formatting is necessary.

C O D E

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a//b)
    print(a/b)



1. Problem Restatement

We are given two integers a and b.
We must:
* Print the result of integer division (a // b)
* Print the result of floating-point division (a / b)
* Each result must be printed on a new line without formatting or rounding.



2. Core Idea / Key Insight

Python provides two fundamentally different division operators, each designed for a different intent:
* // → quotient-only division (floor division)
* / → true division (returns precise decimal result)

The key insight is recognizing which operator preserves integer semantics and which preserves mathematical precision.



3. Step-by-Step Logic (Language-Independent)

1. Read two numeric inputs.
2. Convert inputs into integers to ensure arithmetic operations behave as expected.
3. Compute:
  * Integer division to obtain the quotient without fractional part.
  * Floating division to obtain the exact division result.
4. Output both results on separate lines in the required order.

No loops, conditions, or additional processing are needed because the problem guarantees valid input.



4. Code Walkthrough (Logic → Implementation)

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

* Inputs are read as strings and explicitly converted to integers.
* This avoids accidental string operations or implicit type issues.

print(a // b)

* // performs floor division.
* The result is the largest integer less than or equal to a / b.
* For positive numbers, this behaves like truncation.

print(a / b)

* / performs true division.
* Always returns a floating-point number, even when division is exact.



5. Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(1)
 * Only constant-time arithmetic operations.
Space Complexity: O(1)
 * No additional memory usage beyond two variables.

This is optimal and cannot be improved.



6. Why This Solution Is Optimal

* The task requires exactly two arithmetic operations.
* Python’s built-in operators are already optimized at the interpreter level.
* Any alternative (manual division, conditionals, libraries) would be redundant and inefficient.

Using the correct operator directly is the most precise and readable approach.



7. Common Mistakes & Traps

Using / instead of // for integer division
 * Leads to incorrect output type.
Assuming // always truncates
 * For negative numbers, // floors instead of truncating.
Forgetting type conversion
 * input() returns strings; arithmetic would fail without int().
Trying to format output unnecessarily
 * The problem explicitly forbids formatting.



8. Trade-offs & Alternatives

Alternative: int(a / b)
 * Incorrect for negative values.
 * Slower and less clear.

Alternative: Manual division logic
 * Overengineering.
 * Error-prone.
The chosen solution is clear, safe, and idiomatic Python.



9. Pattern Recognition (Where This Appears Again)

* This distinction appears in:
* Competitive programming problems involving constraints
* Financial calculations (precision vs rounding)
* Index calculations and pagination logic
* Interview questions testing language fundamentals

Rule to remember:

* Use // when we care about discrete units.
* Use / when we care about mathematical accuracy.
